"You find yourself here, attending a wrestling show – er, a Display Of Muscular Theatre, to use the troll terminology – thanks to the benevolence of one Amisia Erdehn. She won the tickets in a raffle and excitedly invited you to come along."

"You agreed, with some reservations that you quickly expressed. She was quite disappointed, but eventually agreed not to kidnap you and keep you locked up as a living paint jar, since you’re buddies and all. What a sweet friend."

"You have to admit, though, muscular theatre isn’t really your thing. It’s as over-the-top and ridiculous as human wrestling, which makes it perfectly entertaining enough, but it’s also, well... a lot more violent."

"Participants aren’t expected to die, as far as you can tell, but you’ve already seen a few get wheeled off on futuristic hover-stretchers with injuries you’re not sure they could survive."

"Every match tonight is taking place within a chain-link cage. Spikes surround it on both the outside and inside and jut out occasionally from the places where the wires cross."

"The overall design, in addition to ensuring maximum bloodshed, seems to keep both the wrestlers inside and the audience out. Ironically, it might be safer this way."

"The current combatants are some oliveblood named The Huntress and a purpleblood calling himself Cullpitz. Interestingly to you, there is nothing clown-like about him at all."

"It is almost conspicuous how unclowny he is, if only due to the absolutely ridiculous amount of clown content you have imbibed in the presence of other purples."

"The two fighters appear to be nearly evenly matched. The olive troll ducks and weaves amid blindingly fast punches from the purple, slashing at him with grandiose arm gestures, trying to overwhelm him with a barrage of small attacks."

"Every one of his punches hits hard enough to knock her down, but she always springs up before he can land a second hit. She’s incredibly steady on her feet, and quicker than he."

"In fact, you get the distinct impression that the olive troll is holding back, presumably so as to avoid inciting the crowd. Thus far, you have not seen a single match in which the lower-blooded opponent triumphed over a higher-blooded foe."
